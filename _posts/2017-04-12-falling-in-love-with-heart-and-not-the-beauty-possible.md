  Can people fall in love without meeting or seeing each other? Can people fall for other&#8217;s heart and not for their beauty or their status? Is it possible for someone to love the other person without knowing their past or their life before?</p> 
  
  <p>
    I think Yes, we can and we only can when we love unconditionally.
  </p>

    People say beauty is not important in love. They say love is blind, so how good the person looks isn&#8217;t something to be concerned about. There are also other set of people who argue that all these &#8220;Love is blind&#8221; &nbsp;are just good for movies and does not work for real life. They feel everyone unconsciously will look for how beautiful their partner is or how rich and well settled they are in their life before falling into love.

    That&#8217;s what we see in movies as well. We see the most handsome guy falling for most cutest and beautiful girl in the movie. Now, whether movie is inspired by people or people get influenced by movies is a different story altogether. This question would have not logical answer.

    But about love, for me love has a very different meaning. Love is not where you give something and expect something from other person. Love for me is unconditional, it just knows how to give.
  </p>

    The best kind of love that has been existing on this earth till date is the love between the baby and its mother. Let&#8217;s look into how this love begins. The mother falls in love with her baby at the very moment she gets to know that she is conceived. And this love increases every other minute as she finds her baby growing inside her.This love has absolutely no expectation. this is the purest kind of love. Does any mother think about the cuteness of the baby? She does not know how the baby is gonna look for those nine months. Yet she loves the baby the same way she did before seeing it, as she will love after she gets it comes into her hand.

    The same is the case with the baby. Does it bother about how beautiful my mother looks? It just knows however she looks, she is the most beautiful person and will be the most beautiful lady for the baby forever.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, that&#8217;s what I call true love. The true love with no boundaries, with no expectations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As babies, when we knew nothing about the world, and still managed to love someone so unconditionally, what happens to us as we grow up?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, for me when I say I love someone, it means the same love that&#8217;s between a mother and the baby, the pure love with no expectations and no strings attached. It is for me a matter of giving love and giving it without any conditions.

    Do you still think, it&#8217;s not possible to love from heart ??
