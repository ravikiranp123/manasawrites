<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  <div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #666666; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">Radha, a girl was born in a joint family with six more cousins. All of them were elder to her. She was the last one and as expected the most pampered girl by everyone from her great grandmother to her aunts and uncles to her cousins. She was raised by all the attention she wanted. She got all the love and care she wanted, maybe more then it.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">As days turned into months and then into years, she grew up to be a beautiful lady. She had parents who loved, cousins who made her happy, aunts who fed her when she was hungry and uncles who granted her every wish and last but not the least, her grandma who never missed to tell her a story before she sleeps. She felt her life was just perfect.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She studied well, got into her dream job. Finally a day arrived when she met the man of her dreams. The best part was that even he felt the same when he saw her for the first time. They met each other in a conference meeting and when they shared those five minutes of their views about the conference during their coffee break, they knew that they were meant for each other. They met again for a couple of times when they finally decided to inform their respective families and get their approval. Both the families had a formal meeting and after an hour of discussing they were on the same page. Their families fixed up a date for engagement. Radha getting engaged to Ravi, read the invitation card. She was very excited about the whole thing. Her happiness had no bound. The big day of engagement arrived, she wore what he had chosen for her and he wore her favourite.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">Everyone who came for the engagement felt that the couples looked great together. In fact they did look great together. They had a big fat dinner party after the engagement in the same hotel just for those two families. Radha and Ravi spoke about everything and anything. They both never grew tired of each other. That must have been the reason why they were with each other on that day. Late in the night, when the families were very tired, they decided to go back to their rooms and rest. But Ravi had other plans, he wanted to make this night even more special for Radha. But he did not inform anyone about it, as he wanted to surprise her lady love. So he told her, that he will go to his room and text her. He went to his parents and told he would like to stay all by himself in his room and not to disturb him till morning. His parents felt he must have been tired cause of the entire day&#8217;s event and agreed to do as he said.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">He then went to the receptionist asked if they had a bike that they could lend to him for few minutes. One guy who was sitting right behind the desk and said, he had it. So Ravi borrowed it for an hour. He took the keys went to the parking lot and searched for the black R15. And he found it, he took it out. It was almost one year he had rode a bike. From the time he got into his new job, he had only been driving car. But still he was confident to ride a bike and he wanted to take her in the bike. This thought stuck him all of a sudden, when she said she loves to watch the night sky, enjoy it in the cool breeze. &nbsp;He went to the place where he could see her room&#8217;s balcony. He gave her a call and asked to come to the balcony. She was shocked to see him down with a bike. He asked her to accompany him for a ride. She did it without a second thought. She informed her cousin about Ravi&#8217;s surprise and asked her not to tell it to her parents as they would definitely not be happy about these crazy things. She took her shawl and rushed to him. They both had an excitement in their eyes.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She sat back to him without uttering an word, held him tight as he sped into the empty roads. He rode the bike as fast as he could as he was high on his happiness. He then stopped near a tea shop on the highway. They both were freezing cold. So, he decided to get her a hot tea and they would share it. As they were sipping the tea, she looked at him and said that it was her most beautiful nights ever in her life, He smiled at her and said it was the same with him. They both were literally out of words. All they spoke was in their eyes,&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">After that as they both were walking to the bike back, he turned towards her, bent on his knees. She did not know how to react. She just watched him with a big smile on her face. He said “Though I know I am engaged to you, but still I somehow feel that my girl needs to be proposed in much special way. Radha, I would like to give you many more beautiful and unforgettable moments in your life, I am happier to see you happy, Will you get me a every chance to make you feel happy and special every moment of my life? Radha was speechless. Though she was always happy by Ravi and his efforts to make her happy, this was the most unexpected yet so beautiful moment he had created for her. She wanted to pinch herself and confirm whether it was a dream. She just went to him hugged him tight and had her eyes filled with tears. She looked at him and said, I would love to have these moments till my very last breath. They both got emotional at that moment. A quite road with very few vehicles passing by, chilling breeze and the dark night sky with lots of stars shining all made it perfect for them to have a best proposal ever they could imagine. They stood there for a while looking into each other and then suddenly realized it’s already 3am and they need to rush back to the hotel before their parents get to know.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">So he took the bike, started riding it. She held him tighter then she had done when they were coming. There was a much special bond created between them, this night had made them love each other even more than ever. This was in fact the best day in their lives. He was happy that his plan had worked out as he wanted it. He knew she would never forget this night and his efforts were worth her happiness.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">As they were heading towards the hotel, the fate had to play its part. As they both had thought that this night would remain a memorable one for both of them, did not actually remain the same. Ravi was what people call as cloud nine. He was never so happy ever in his life, but he did not that this would be his last few minutes of his happiness. As he was speeding over the empty road, there was a junction which had roads from four sides crossing over. He saw that the signals were not there from the far and so he went without horn. He did not expect that big truck to come from the other road. He suddenly saw it approaching towards him, he did not know how to control the bike, he wanted to stop and applied break, but his breaks were not working the way he wanted them too. Radha who was watching his efforts and watching the truck coming towards them all she could do was shout. These few seconds appeared to be the longest time of their lives.&nbsp;She only remembered parts of scenes where the truck had hit them and the bike had crashed to the end of the divider. She was separated from Ravi and had fallen very far from him. Her whole body ached with wounds and she could sense her head bleed. But she did not want to close her eyes, she wanted to watch him, go to him and hold his hand to see if he was alright. But her body did not allow her to do that. She remembered her eyes getting&nbsp;closed against her will.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">When she got her senses back, she could sense cool breeze on her skin. She gently tried to open her eyes, her view was very blurred. She could see some people standing in front of her. She tried to move her hand, but she could not. She could feel the pains in different parts of her body. She tried to open her eyes wider and now she could see her parents and her cousin standing there with worried face. She had only one thought in her mind, Where is Ravi? She struggled to get her voice, but managed to whisper his name. They all stood there without talking a word. She thought that they did not hear her, she asked a bit louder this time, Ravi, I need to see him. Her mother who was right next to her started weeping badly and her dad help her mother&#8217;s hand and looked into her eyes with tears in them.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She sensed that something was wrong with him, she grew more anxious, she lifted her hand and asked her to take him to her. they all were still silent. She now forcefully tried to get up with all her strength, watching this her uncle came to her and said &#8221; He is no more, he died on the spot in the accident.&#8221; She could not take it, she saw everyone and said, I want to see him, please take me to him. Her Uncle told her that she can&#8217;t see him as he was buried the very next day as he was declared bought dead to the hospital and she was in ICU without any conscious for 3 days. She could feel the whole room going in circles, she wanted to just die at the very moment, but how could she? She started crying profusely, her parents, her uncle every one tried to comfort her. But she did not wanted any of their comforts, she wanted him back. For the next few days, she cursed god for making her life so miserable, but did not get satisfied with it.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks, but she remained in that night forever. There was no way she could forget him, everything reminded her on him. Her whole family was doing all they can to bring her back to life, but they all were failing miserably. One day she thought of visiting his house and talk to his parents. She told her parents, though her parents were not really happy with her decision, they asked her to do what she likes and which would make her feel better.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She got ready and went to his house, his parents welcomed her. This was the first time after the engagement that she was meeting them. They were like her still not out of his loss. She went to his room which was tidy, but had all his belongings in their places. She sat on the bed, watched his cupboard, his table and the laptop in which he used to have video calls with her, when he went out of stations. The memories were still so fresh, she felt a strange ache in her heart. She sat there for hours thinking about him. And after few hours, she came out of the room. His dad was sitting their staring at the TV, he was certainly not paying any attention to it. She walked in front of him and he saw her, turned off the TV. She sat on the sofa, he said how he still misses Ravi and his presence. He also told what happened on that night, how they got a call to the hotel they stayed and the way they rushed to find him already dead and her in critical state. As he was saying about it, he mentioned something that pulled her attention. He spoke about how Ravi had a major head injury, but his other organs were fine and that his heart was in a condition to transplant to someone. And it was a 6 year old guy, who wanted a heart at that very moment and the doctors did the operation and transplanted his heart to that boy and saved his life.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She wanted to meet that boy, only thing that she had apart from Ravi&#8217;s memories was his heart. She asked about the information about that boy. Ravi&#8217;s dad was not very sure, so he gave her the doctor&#8217;s number. She called him and got to know that, this boy was an orphanage who&#8217;s mom had the same heart problem and her husband had abandoned her when she was pregnant. She died when the baby was 9 months old due to heart problem. Then the baby was grown up by the orphanage.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She got the address of the orphanage and went to see that boy. As she waited in the room for him, she saw a very cute boy approaching her with a smile on his face. He came to her and stood smiling, she bent down and asked him what was his name, he said &#8220;Kiran&#8221;. She took him to her arms and hugged him. As she released him, she asked him &#8220;Will you come with me to my home?&#8221; His smile vanished for a minute and then asked her &#8220;Will I get chocolates and toys there ?&#8221;. She smiled at him and said &#8221; How much ever you want !&#8221;. She said those words and he started to jump with joy, she held his face and kissed his forehead. He stopped jumping with joy and asked &#8220;What should I call you ?&#8221;. She thought for a while and said &#8220;Mom&#8221;. He did not think twice before saying, “Mom: take me to my new home&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">She adopted him as her son, her parents were not happy at her decision. But she knew that she was already married to Ravi and no other guy would fill his place. And now that Ravi&#8217;s heart still beats in Kiran, she wanted to be a mother to him, so that she could hear his heartbeat till the end of her life. Kiran did ask about why he did not have a dad, but Radha would say he may be physically absent, but he is still there watching him and her. Kiran did not actually think much about it, as he had a whole new family with his mom, so the very feel of people caring was a big joy to him.<o:p></o:p></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; line-height: 12pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">

      <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">Every year on the day of her engagement she would drive to the place where Ravi had proposed her, sit there in the tea shop for a while and get back to her home with a feel that he is still around her, watching her and caring her as he always did. She believed that only people are mortal, but the love will always remain Immortal.<o:p></o:p></span>
