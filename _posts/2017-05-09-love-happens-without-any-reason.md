    I was woken by the strong smell of coffee. I opened my eyes to the sunrays that hit directly through the colorful windows. I woke up bit late as I wasn’t feeling well, and by the time I got up and adjusted my hair, the door opened. He entered the room with a cup; he had a big smile on his face as she saw me awake. He came to me and kissed my forehead softly. I took the cup, and smelled the coffee. I looked at him and said,”Perfect blend baby”. He came close to my ears and whispered “Not as good as your coffee”. He asked, how I was doing, I told him I am better. He said he is trying to cook today and asked me to drink my coffee slowly and join him in kitchen if I can. He had always been this caring from day one. Unconditional love and care was unlimited in him. As I sipped the coffee, I felt how lucky was I to be part of Ranjith’s life.

    My memories raced back to that day, I saw him for the first time. He had come with one of my cousin for a wedding. The first time I saw him, I observed him for almost half an hour from far, he was smart, bit plump but cute and way too fair. I really don’t know what attracted me in him. I guess that’s what people call Love at first sight, which I always thought never existed except in movies. After a while I got tired of watching him from far, finally decided to go to my cousin and say him a hello, so that I would get to know this new person. I went straight to my cousin, said him a hello, we as usual started complaining how we don’t text each other, trying to argue who’s mistake is it. Then, I asked him about the one who was standing next to him. All this while, he just stood there without even bothered to look at us. He was lost in his own world. My cousin tapped on his shoulder and said, This is Ranjith, he joined our company recently he has come from Mumbai and he is staying with me for a week till he finds for a house nearby. I thought that he will be bored alone at home, so got him with me. I saw him with a smile and said “Nice to meet you, Ranjith”. He held his hand and gave a firm hand shake and said “Same here”. I wanted to ask him more, but thought to keep a full stop to my curiosity as he may find it weird. I thought he would ask me something, but no. He stood there least bothered that I even existed. &nbsp;So I excused myself and went to look for my other relatives and cousin. But in the whole wedding I was trying to see where he went, whom he met and what he did. I myself felt this behavior of mine a bit awkward, but I was so curious to know about him. Even after observing him so much, I could only see him being lost, not interested to talk to anyone, he was just polite and trying to look fine. I thought to myself, god knows what’s going in his brain, if he was so disinterested he should have stayed back rather than coming here and being like an alien. Then we finally left the place, but he was captured in my head.

    It was a week after I met Ranjith, I wanted to call my cousin and ask for more details about him, but refrained myself from doing it. But I secretly prayed to meet him someday very soon. I was still not sure, why I was so interested in him, but I wanted to meet him somehow. On the next weekend, I had planned to meet few of my friends in a nearby mall. I reached on time to find both of my friends still on their way. One was stuck in traffic; the other was almost done with her shopping and was heading to the mall.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I decided to take a small tour of the mall, basically do some window shopping till one of them made it to mall. As I was walking past the games arena, I noticed one cute little boy aged about 4 years, lost and looking for someone. I went to him and asked, whom he came with. He was almost in tears when he said, “My dad bought me here, and I don’t find him now. I told him not to cry and gave him a chocolate that I had bought for myself. He took it without any hesitation, but still with the fear of not finding his dad. I told him I will help him find his dad, and as I was talking to him, I heard a bit familiar voice calling out “Aarav, Where were you all this while? I turned to ask that person how he could be so careless when he comes with his kid but I stood there with my eyes and mouth wide. I was in a shock and could only whisper his name “Ranjith”! He saw me and told a hello and went to the kid and gave him a tight hug. I was standing there without knowing how to react. After a while Ranjith turned towards me and thanked me. I wanted to ask him a lot of questions once again, but managed to ask only one, “So you came with your family?” And he answered “Yes, me and my son”. I was still confused, by then one of friends reached mall and gave me a call, I said bye to both Ranjith and his son and walked to my friend with a lot of doubts and questions in mind. During all my time with friends, I could only think about how I was in love with a married man, a married man with a son. But where is his wife. And why did he say me and my son. So many unanswered questions spoiled the peace of my mind.

    That day night I could not stop myself without calling my cousin, he was sleeping I guess, he picked up the call and asked why I called him in this odd hour, he was worried, if anything was wrong. I assured him nothing that serious but I just wanted to know something. He asked what it was, I asked him about Ranjith, he was confused and bit irritated with me for asking about him at that point of time. But then I told him how I met Ranjith &nbsp;in the mall with his son, then he sounded bit convinced and asked me to meet him next day, as it was something he could not say it on phone. I pleaded him a couple of times, by asking about his wife and his family. He totally refused to say a word about him. I was not sure, why I was so curious about that guy, but something let me be awake that whole night thinking about every other possibility. And next day I was waiting till the evening and had already called my cousin a couple of times. He finally had to warn me not to call again and that he will meet me for sure by evening 5 in a coffee shop . I reached the place 30mins early. He came on time and asked what I would like to order, I told him anything would be fine. He understood how impatient I was and said that Rajinth shifted a week back to his new house with his mom and his son. And without a second gap, I asked him”what about his wife”? He then told me how he had lost his wife in a car accident 3 months back. He married Monika 6 years back. It was a love marriage. Monika was his junior from the same college. They had fallen in love madly with each other, and also fought for each other with their families and finally got married. That’s when they shifted to Mumbai. My cousin showed me the picture of them, Ranjith and Monika, also they both with Aarav as a baby. She was very pretty. He then told me how when Monika went to leave her son to school in the morning, she lost control over the car and rammed into a truck and was killed on spot.

    He told that as her memories made it very difficult to him to stay in Mumbai in that flat, he applied for transfer to Bangalore, and so he is here with his son and his mom. It took me few minutes to digest what my cousin had told me. After sometime, I asked him to make me meet him, he was skeptical and said he is not ready to meet anyone as he does not like to, and that he had force him to come out on that day as well. And now since his mom and son are here, he only spends time with them apart from work. He also warned me not to do anything stupid. But I somehow pleaded him till he finally agreed to make me meet him once.

    I was not sure, whether this was love or just an infatuation, but all I wanted was to meet him. And so I did meet him, he was as usual very quite. Then I asked him to share his number, he was taken aback when I did that, but eventually gave it. Then we started talking on phone, texting at times.&nbsp; I started meeting Dhruv more often and he enjoyed my company. After 3 months I told Ranjith that I was willing to marry him. Initially he started avoiding me, did not talk to me or receive my call for close to a month. But then I was persistent. He finally met me and told how for him, his son is more important then he having a wife. I had already developed a good rapport with Aarav, he was happy when I told him I will be shifting to his home and staying with him. Ranjith waited for 4 more months during which we actually understood each other. He told me how he was still in love with Monica and how much he missed her. It was not easy for him to erase his memories with her, nor did I force him to do it.

    After those months, he came to my home to talk to my parents. They had the shock of their lives. My parents were in search of the groom for me, and I falling in love with Ranjith was unacceptable to them. But I told them, how I wanted to be only with Ranjith. Finally they did agree. I got married to him.</p> 
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;It’s already 2 years since I got married to him. These were happiest moments of my life till now. Ranjith has given me more love then I expected, much more happiness then I ever dreamt off.

    I suddenly realized the coffee cup was empty, I see the time, its half past seven. I rush to another room, where Aarav is still fast asleep to wake him up. He is initially resistant, but then wakes up by wishing a sweet good morning and hugging me tight. I help him take bath, and let him dress. I go to kitchen to see what Ranjith is up to, he is busy frying something. As soon as he sees me, he tells me what all I should take care of and rushes to get ready. I complete the dishes, pack lunch for both and keep it ready. They sit and have breakfast, grab their bags and leave with a big smile and Aarav screams “Mummy, bye”. I say them bye and wait till they get into the car and drive past the lane.

    I stood their wondering what made me fall for Ranjith, I still don’t know. Whatever it is, I feel I did the right decision sharing my life with him. I remember someone once saying “You don’t need any reason to fall in love with someone, its love only when it happens for no reason”.&nbsp;
