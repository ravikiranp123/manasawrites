<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  <div>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I sat out of the labor room. I am here from morning. My mom walks to me and holds my hand to comfort me. I look at her and try to control my tears. But they end up trickling down. I rest my head on her lap. She held my head and said &#8221; Things will be fine&#8221;. I thought to myself that I&#8217;m praying for the same. I&#8217;m not a guy who had ever asked for something in my prayers. My life was perfect. I had most loving parents, ever caring elder sister and ever troubling yet my favorite younger brother. There was nothing better I could ask for. Until Shreyaa entered my life. <o:p></o:p></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Yes, Shreyaa, the bold and arrogant girl of my class. I still remember the initial meeting of mine with her. She joined our school when I was in 5th std. Then was those days when as kids to avoid us making hell lot of noise, the class teacher&#8217;s had to use a strategy where we guys were made to sit next to the girls. And trust me we guys hated that. Whenever we got a break, we would run to out best friends in a different row and talk to them. The girls would do the same. We would talk about the amazing car that we saw on our way or play rock, paper and scissors. Girls would sit in their groups and giggle for not so funny things. <o:p></o:p></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And things in school went on peaceful until Shreyaa sat next to me. I never liked her. Though I never liked anyone in girls. But there was a particular dislike towards this particular girl. Maybe her arrogance, or maybe that I don&#8217;t care attitude or her rude behavior towards anyone and everyone. Something was motivating me to hate her. And I prayed everyday that the day should never come, when she had to sit next to me. But as the fate had it, the day arrived when we were all shuffled and as I never wanted it, Shreyaa sat next to me. On that day I went back with the sad face and I remember complaining to my mom how I did not want to sit next to her. I forced my mom for the next three days to come to my school and ask my class teacher to change my place. My mom kept postponing it by saying she was busy. I understood that did not want to come and change my place. She used sit with me during our dinner time and explain how no one was bad until we don&#8217;t really trouble them. But whatever she told would never convince me. I wanted to tell her that Shreyaa was not like the rest, but I was sure she would not get my point. Everyday was a burden to me. And each day there used to be some incident that would ultimately lead to hate her even more. Until one fine day the fight went out of my hands. And I told that she was the baddest girl I have ever known in my life. Her face was burning with anger. Her fair skin had turned all red, she in that moment of rage picked up her pencil and poked my hand very hard. The pain was so intense that I burst out shouting and crying. One of my friends watched what had happened and he ran to the staffroom. In a few minutes there was my class teacher and the head miss trying to do the first aid. All I remember was how I was crying the whole time. Then within an hour, my mom had arrived, she took me into her arms and said things are going to be fine. I cried even more as I saw her and told her that I dont want to come to school if Shreyaa is in the school. My mom just kissed me on my forehead and said &#8221; Aarav let&#8217;s go home and on the way, you will get your favorite ice cream&#8221;. Though the word ice cream did make me feel bit better, but the pain was still there. <o:p></o:p></span>

    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I got it dressed and doctor said it&#8217;s nothing to worry and I could start writing in a week. So I started going back to school after 2 days of rest. More then rest it was thought about going back to sit next to her demotivated me. Infact I clearly remember how I begged my mom asking her not to drop me to school. Like every other mother, she thought missing out on classes would end up in a lot of writing, which will be problematic later. She somehow convinced me to go and I left. <o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As I entered the class, all my friends gathered to look at my hand. I had to tell them, what the doctor did and how he tied the bandage and also whether I could write or will someone write for me etc. &nbsp;Answering them, I looked at my place to see if she was sitting there. To my surprise, I did not find her. Instead of her, I saw Aradhya sitting and writing something in her book. Aradhya was one of the most quitiest girl in the class. I was happy seeing her, but one question that was in my head was, where is Shreyaa. I silently searched for her. I could not find her at all. I wondered what had happened to her. I did not feel like asking my friends as well. I just sat in my place. Classes went on, but I was thinking where she must be. Lunch bell rang, all of us ran out to the ground. &nbsp;As we were eating lunch, I could see someone trying to hide back of tree beside me. After the lunch, my friends went to play, I had to sit there as I had injured my hand. Any injury means no playing in schools. I sat there alone watching everyone play. Immersed in the game, suddenly I heard a familiar voice saying “ I m sorry”. I turned to see who it was. And for a second I had all emotions rushing in me. I looked away from her. But Shreyaa again came infront of me and asked sorry. I had never asked sorry to anyone. Though she had never injured anyone like me, but she asking for sorry was unusual. I remembered my mother’s words, to forgive is always the best thing to do, so did I. I looked at her and said “It’s Okay. She was still standing there, I asked her what else she wanted. She said, “Can I eat my lunch with you?”. I wanted to push her away. Infact hit her hard, but I just controlled my anger and said “No”. She still did not move, I asked her to go with her group of friends, she claimed she had none. And I thought why would anyone be with her. After few minutes of persistent request, I asked her to sit quietly and eat. She did as I asked her to do. The bell rang, she helped me pack my box and got it till class. She gave to me, I stood there and asked, why is she not in my class. She said how because of what happened with him, few parents had complained to the class teacher to change her class. So now she belonged to B Sec. I did not what to reply, so said “Okay,Bye” and walked into my class. From next day we eating together became routine. Initially I did not talk much, but gradually we started talking. I never expected that she could so sweet too. As days passed by I got to know that her parents were getting divorced very soon. She always saw them fight. She would show her anger on students here. She somehow felt comfortable with me. I used to tell my mom about her and her parents fight. My mom started packing extra lunch to her as she always bought only bread and jam. She enjoyed eating my home food. And I started to enjoy her company. <o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We became better friends every passing year. She now stayed with her mother alone. Things were better at her home now. Once in a while we were in same section, then in 9<sup>th</sup> std again shifted. But nothing could affect our friendship. The whole school knew we were best friends. If she wasn’t well, I would stay back at home giving reasons like having headache or stomach ache. My mom believed me every time. We both did have other friends, but no one ever understood us like each other. We then moved to same college for our 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade. But we had got seat in different colleges for our engineering courses. Both of us were very unhappy. But we promised to meet each other regularly. We did keep up that promise for few months, and then failed to meet more often like before. We used to fight, in fact fight a lot. We were very easily disappointed when we could not meet. This is the point we actually realized that we are not just friends, but we did love each other. And this made us even closer to one other. We both made sure we don’t get distracted from our career goals. We finally got placed into leading software companies. After getting in job, our lives changed even more drastically. I was working for night shift and she in general shift. We could not at all meet each other, we made several plans that failed every time. After two years, she told me she will quit her job. I wanted to know why, she simply answered, “I don’t wanna work anymore, let’s get married, I will help your mom with her works”. I was surprised by her words at the very same happy for her decision to marry me. We both decided to break the news in our homes. Her mother was happy with her choice, but my home had problems initially. My mom did have a clue about this, so she was okay with it, but my dad wasn’t. He was unhappy about getting a girl from a broken family. But I was persistent. And finally he had to agree.<o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We did tie a knot after a year of convincing at my home. My dad took some time to start talking to her, but she had it in her, she could make anyone like her. She very soon became the favorite of everyone at home. After three years, she arranged a surprise dinner party for me and told me that I am going to soon be a dad; there were no limits to my happiness. <o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I was startled by someone shaking my shoulder; I looked up to see my dad. I realized where I was. He handed me a coffee and asked me not to worry and things would better. How could things get better, even after what the doctor told me in the morning? He had clearly told that, both the baby and mother are in serious condition and they could not say anything till the operation was done. He also said, there may be chances of losing one life in the whole process. I wanted both of them, and Shreyaa had dreamt so much about the baby and now she laid unconscious in the operation theatre. There is no day in my life that I had prayed so much. I waited few hours which seemed endless. <o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">After an hour, I saw the doctor approaching me. I stood there tensed and anxious as never before. She saw me with a smile and said “Sir, your wife is really lucky, she is out of danger and so is your daughter, you can see them in as they will be shifted to the ward”. I had no words to say, I had tears, tears filled with joy. I must have thanked doctor a hundredth time in few minutes. The doctor told that the baby had to under special care for a week, which the hospital will be taking care. She also mentioned that the baby must be taken care a bit more carefully. I listened to everything she said by giving maximum attention. After explaining, she left and I sat there to watch my angel. <o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I went into the room; I could see Shreyaa, sleeping there. I went near to her, she woke up for rhe sound and smiled at me. We spoke in silence as I kissed her and we both had tears filled in our eyes. Then I went to the cradle next to her, there was the small angle wrapped in beautiful pink cloth. She was sleeping with a small smile in her lips. The joy of watching her made me realize that all those silent prayers were worth and the happiness I experienced made me forgot all the anxious moments from morning. I watched her with wonder for so long and yet wanted to watch for long, that was her magic. I saw Shreyaa and smiled at her thinking, a girl who once gave me so much of pain at that small age is the same one who is giving me boundless amount of joy. The one, whom I hated the most, is now loved most. I now feel so glad that she did hurt me on that day or I would miss so much in my life.</span>
