<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  <div>
    Success has different meanings for different people. It is very subjective to each one of us. For some success means landing into their dream job, for some it’s earning their dream money, becoming rich and for some it might be as simple as leading a happy and satisfied life.<br />When asked my friend, she gave it a different view to it altogether. She said&#8230;.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Success for me has a whole different meaning, when will I be success…..</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    It is very huge crowd,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    They are eagerly waiting for the results, just as anxious as I am
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The whole air is filled in with suspense,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The anchor on the stage starts the countdown,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    As, he starts calling out each number,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My heartbeat increases, my breathing is uneven,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Yes, I am tensed and I am tensed like I was never before
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Seems like I was waiting for this moment from don’t know when,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I am trying to calm myself down, stay composed.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I am trying to smile
  </div>
  
  <div>
    And now the number reduced to 0….
  </div>
  
  <div>
    There is much more silence now, the silence that we call pin-drop silence
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I don’t know how to react; I just stare at him, straight into his eyes.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    He looks with a beam of hope,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I silently hold his hand; I can feel his hands are shivering,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I want to hear that name, these few seconds feels like the longest waited times to me,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Then they announce the name, HIS NAME
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I was so happy, I closed my eyes as a tear rolled down.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I can’t believe it, but yes it’s true. He won it.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I find him pulling me towards and giving me a tight hug.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    He kissed my cheek, as he whispered “Thank you my dear wife”
  </div>
  
  <div>
    He then turned towards the stage, walked with a pride, head held up to collect his Award.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    His award for all these years of hard work, the pain and yes the patience,&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The crowd was calling his name whistling and howling with happiness.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I stood there watching all this and smiled towards the sky with gratitude “Thank you”
  </div>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <div>
    That moment, yes…. That very moment will be my Success.
  </div>
