    I got up with a lot of tiredness. I opened my eyes to see the time, it was still five o’clock. As I got up and felt my head spinning. I held my head and sat till I felt better. I saw Akash, he was still fast asleep. I wanted to wake him. But for a moment I thought this must be due to missing my dinner in the night. I had prepared my favorite aloo with gobi. But by the time, I sat with Akash to have food and suddenly started feeling like puking. So had to leave, without even tasting the food. This had never happened to me. I went through memories of all day. And when I felt I was better off, so got up to go to kitchen. As I walked towards the door, all I remembered is me bumping into door and I was on floor. When I opened my eyes, Akash was next to me. He came closer to me and asked, if I was feeling better. I was feeling better. I smiled at him and said sorry. He told me, his sleep wasn’t that important than my health. He handed me a fruit juice and helped me drink it. He took a off so we could go to doctor together. He made his all time favorite Cheese butter sandwich for both of us. Akash does not know how to cook; in fact he learnt to make sandwich just for me. He is the youngest in the family, hence pampered kid but also the responsible one. I got ready as he booked the appointment in the hospital. I felt Akash was making a fuss about a small thing, I tried talking to him, convincing him to go to office and assuring him that if I would take a day rest, everything would be fine. He was not ready to listen to me. So, I gave up. Akash is that way, I don’t think being determined about few things is bad, but always wanting to go things the way he wants it, irritates me at times. The only thing which makes me agree to him is that whenever he decides on anything he would have thought it for a million times about the consequences, the situation and the alternatives. So, he is usually best in his decision. I am quite opposite to him in this; I am a person who likes to take spontaneous decisions. So most of the times, I do agree to him. We drove to the hospital, got an appointment and sat waiting for our turn. We went to the doctor; she did a normal check up and asked few questions.&nbsp; She finally asked me to go for pregnancy test. I was a little puzzled; I then realized I was so busy that I had not realized missing my dates for last two months. &nbsp;Akash gave me a glance and I just smiled at him. I knew why he gave me that glance, but I had no clue either. The very thought of me getting pregnant gave me mixed feelings. Me and Akash had never actually planned for anything. Not that we never wanted to have a baby. We were so busy in both our careers that we never actually thought about it. I went for the test and after the test I secretly wished that the result should come as positive. I did not tell about this to Akash, as we waited, asked me if we were ready. I did not know what to answer, I just looked at him. He held my hand and said, I guess we are. I was happy that he understood my unspoken words. And as we expected results turned out to be positive. Both of us were very happy. We called my parents and in laws and told about the good news. As, we were staying far from home, we wanted both families to come and join us for a get together. My mom in law confirmed about the sweets that I like, so that she could get them all for me. I told her not to get lots of them, as I would not able to complete everything. She told me how to eat healthy foods and also what not to eat and what not to eat. And then, it was my mother’s turn. All this while, Akash kept looking at me and smiling. We took appointment for our next check up. I prepared my mind for this big change in my life. I was happy and scared at the very same time. Days went by and I could slowly feel movements in my stomach. This new feeling had happiness which found no bounds. My in laws and parents took turns and visited me.

    As the date of the delivery was approaching, a strange feeling of afraid started. Akash was a great support for me. He was with me, for most of the times. He knew I was going through a lot mixed feelings. He kept on telling me, not to get stressed. Though, I tried to be all the calm, a sense of fear still stayed. One fine day as me, my mom and Akash were talking I started having terrible pains. Akash accompanied me for the delivery. As we were reaching, I could not bare the pain, my eyes were slowing showing blurred images. I did not know what was happening. And after a moment I don’t remember anything.

    I opened my eyes as I felt my body aching. I could see Akash next me holding my hand. I moved my hand, so he got to know I was awake. I looked at him and searched for my baby. I could not see any cradles. I looked at him in a question mark. He came closer to me and kissed my forehead, saying “Hey I guess you are too tired, relax for sometime”. I was a little taken aback. I asked him again, “Can I see the baby?”. He turned towards the other side and I could feel him wiping his tears. I tried to get up, but my body did not support it. I fell in the attempt. Akash saw me and held me tight and said, “Please stay calm as I explain you what has happened”. His eyes were filled with tears, I wanted to badly know what had happened.

    He told me everything from the time I had lost my conscious. As he told me how complicated my situation was and how the baby could not get enough oxygen, I felt the ground trembling and I was losing track of what Akash was talking. But I tried hard to regain my conscious. And I prayed that I should not hear what he was about to say. Baby could not breath and had to die in the process of delivery. I could not take this news. I did not know what to speak. I was all broken. My mom came to see me. I was crying uncontrollably. After a day, I got discharged.

    Days went very slow, I was on maternity leave, my HR got to know about my situation. She offered me to join the work when I am okay. I was not okay, not going to okay anytime soon.I was not entertaining any guests, I did not like talking to anyone. Akash, was busy with his life. My mom stayed for few days, she tried her best to cheer up. But I could not feel better about it, but only feel more worse about the situation. On a Sunday morning, Akash called to my mobile, only after seeing his name did I realize he is not next to me.&nbsp; I wondered where he left so early in the morning. I picked up his call, he asked me to come to the lawn. I did not know why, I asked him but he wasn’t ready to say. I walked towards the lawn and could hear some sounds. As I opened the door, Akash was with a basket with two cute puppies. They were making those noises. Dogs were always my favorite, but Akash never liked dogs. Infact he stayed away from dogs as much as possible. I did tried to convince him a few times, but could never make him agree. But watching them in his hands was no wonder a surprise to me. I ran to him and picked both of them. They were already name, Dora and Cutie. I really loved how Akash did something so amazing to make me busy. He came closer to me and said, “You have two babies to take care now, don’t worry we will be great parents to them”. He smiled as he looked at me. I kissed him and whispered a thank you.

    I was glad for this new unexpected guest. On that day, I realized that angels can also come in the form of four legged furry creatures too.
