    I am tired and irritated. I feel like running away from these crazy people around me. My parents are sitting opposite to me, with their sad faces. I haven’t seen them this worried from quite few years. They are very worried. And so are my two uncles who are sitting on the sofa beside me. I just sit, watching their faces. I want to speak, I want to tell them what I am thinking, but I don’t do it as I know ultimately they will say “Don’t talk like you know everything, we elders here are solve the things for you, listen to what we say”. So, I thought it’s better to keep my mouth shut, but my mind was all over the place.

    Finally one of uncle said, “Sister, I will talk to another astrologer near my locality, my friends at work told me he is really good in his predictions, let me take her horoscope and show it to him. I am pretty sure, he will have a solution.” My mom had a hope in her eyes, she asked him to do it as soon as possible. He said he will try getting an appointment today itself. He walked out of the house, and my parents started talking among themselves. My other uncle started giving other alternatives for the issue.

    I sat in the corner thinking, is this really such a big concern to worry about? &nbsp;Maybe it was for my parents. But for me, it was just a superstition. According to me deciding about a person whether he/she is happy in their married life or not based on the planets shown in horoscope is nothing but close to stupidity. But my parents never got my point. And on top of that, few guys and their families rejecting me had made it even worse for them. I was happy as I did not like those guys who rejected me. One was very talkative, the other was too tall for me, and the other was bit plump. So I was not feeling bad for any rejections.

    It was almost a week after that big discussion had happened, we were having our breakfast when the phone rang, and my mom went to pick it. She spoke for few seconds and got back to the dining table. She saw me and said, “Get ready on Sunday; your uncle is getting one family”. I just nodded my head without any reaction. This was my routine these weekends; only thing I enjoy is trying different hairstyles. Nothing excites me now. For the first time, when there was a guy a coming to see, there was a lot of excitement, but after that every time my mom asked me to dress up; I would just do it robotically. We silently sat there and had our breakfast and left to our works respectively. I only remembered all this only at home. As I left my home, I forgot totally about my marriage, the worry my parents had; I just enjoyed my work and everything else in my life.

    On Saturday, I got up a bit late and I could hear my dad saying something loud to my mother. But I can’t understand why he is talking in his top of his voice. I walked out to see what is going wrong. My dad was saying “We can’t do this to them, what will they think if they got to know about it. I don’t want to spoil my daughter’s life myself”. I was not getting what they were talking about. My mom silently walked into the kitchen. I followed her and asked her when we went to kitchen about what was that discussion all about. She looked at me innocently and said, “It is your uncle’s idea to change your Date of birth in the horoscope so it can match”. I saw her and explained not to do all this and also asked to let her brother know not to do this again. She tried to give her justification about the incident. But I just heard her and nodded my head.

    My dad had decided to call those people who were about to come tomorrow and inform them about the correction in my date of birth. My mom was pretty sure, when my dad will inform about the change in date, they will not come tomorrow. I sat looking at what’s coming on my way. Finally my dad called and informed, it seems that they heard it patiently and said they will call back after half an hour. I was already making plans for tomorrow cause like my mom I too thought that they will not come, so one Sunday to treat myself the way I want. I was thinking which all friends I can meet and spend some good time talking about everything under the sun.

    My dad got a call after an hour; they spoke only for few minutes. My dad kept the call and looked at me and said “They will be coming tomorrow; it seems the boy insisted on coming here and meet us however”. I felt really sad about all my plans getting cancelled, but I also had this thought in my mind, who is this guy wanting to meet my family after all this hungama. &nbsp;I just let the thought pass by. I go back to my mobile to inform my friends how I will not be able to make it for tomorrow’s get together. I feel very bad as it was me who arranged the whole get together and now I will not be attending it.

    Then next day I woke up with the thought of me meeting another guy. It’s close to half past eight. My mom comes to see me still lazing in my bed, she starts off with her old routine lines of when you will become responsible, and why do u sleep till so late and so much more. I only pay attention to her first two words, and I know the rest by heart so I don’t hear them after that. I get fresh, then check for some nice traditional with a mix of modern hairstyle on my mobile while I eat my breakfast. Finally I am satisfied with one of the hairstyles, my dad calls out from his room that they are on their way and will be there in an hour. For me hour is a lot of time, so I sit their thinking about everything I should not think. These days, I have got used getting ready in span of few minutes, thanks to those people who come way early then we would be expecting them. I go after half an hour to get ready, and by an hour I could hear people talking.

    &nbsp;I sit there all dressed up waiting for my dad to call me. And he calls me after few minutes. I walk to the hall, my head bend trying not to be curious. Not that I was not, but I had been asked not to lift my head and stare at every individual out there as it does not look good for a girl especially when there is guy’s family coming to see you. I walk straight to the place where I usually sit. Then my parents and his parents talk about so many unwanted things as they don’t know what they should actually talk. I just sit there watching them and trying to see how the guy looks. While talking I see his dad addressing him as Rakesh, so that’s how I got to know his name. He seemed pretty okay, In fact really good when compared to earlier guys. He seemed to be quite absorbed in the conversation happening. He wore a light blue formal shirt. He had an attractive smile and off course, had a great voice. He did make some very valid points of what our parents were discussing. He kept looking at me once in awhile and I made sure I looked away as he looked at me, as I did not wanted him to know that I am staring at him.

    After sometime, he looked at his dad and said, “Can I talk to her for few minutes?” His father looked at my dad and my dad had an instant reflex eye contact with me and gave a sign to take him to the lawn outside. This was the first time; a guy whom came to see had asked to talk to me. Most of them came waited till their parents did all the talking and left. And as usual after they saw my horoscope, they would reject the proposal. But this was something very abnormal, I walked in front of him leading to the lawn outside. I stood as we reached almost the end of the garden and turned towards him. I was very clueless what to talk.

    He started talking; he was pretty clear at what he spoke. I felt like he had prepared whole night. Then he also asked about my studies, the job that I do and things that I love the most. I did not have any clue what to ask him in return so asked the same questions he had asked me. I felt a bit stupid as I was asking the same questions, but he seemed to be least bothered about it. He answered it very genuinely. We spoke for 20 minutes and I had a real good feeling about him. I don’t know what he felt, but I was pretty sure he was happy as his smile at the end said it all.

    &nbsp;We walked to our parents, and he said something to his mom. They started talking in low voices among themselves. I stood for a moment and my dad asked me to get water for him to drink. I went to the kitchen and got him the water, as the boy’s father said, “My son likes your daughter, he would like to meet her couple of more times and see if they will get along well. My dad saw me, I did not know how to react, he turned towards their family and said” But the horoscope matching has not been done still”. Now I heard the same voice of Rakesh say, “Sir, I don’t believe in these horoscopes, if me and her think we are compatible, then I don’t think we need any planets to guide us to stay together. &nbsp;Without my knowledge I was staring at him with a very big smile. He saw me and smiled back. I guess he understood what I was trying to say. That was the moment I fell for him. My parents were still hesitant to go for it in the start. But somehow, they did agree to what he had to say.

    I met him few more times after the meeting in our house and every time we met, we got well with each other better than before. And later got engaged after 4 months and finally tied a knot after 6 months. It’s not that we never fought, we did fight a lot, but every time we had an argument, we always had something to learn. We just knew, we had decided to stay together no matter what we would be with each other. Its 3 years we have been married and when I hear people talking about the Horoscope I think how it mattered if their Horoscopes matched or not, if two people decide to stay together, their planets will come together and get matched by itself. Like mine and Rakesh’s did.&nbsp;
