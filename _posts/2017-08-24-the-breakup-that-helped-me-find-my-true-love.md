  <div>
    I sat there in a shock watching him leave. It took a while to pull myself back. He had shattered me into pieces just by his words. Those words cut me deeper then any swords could. One sentence that stuck me from our conversation was &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how to handle a relationship&#8221;. Those words kept lingering in my head till I reached my home. My mom welcomed me with a hug as everyday, I did not respond appropriately. She got to know, that there was something that was bothering me. She held my hands, looked into my eyes and said “Whatever it is, it&#8217;s going to be fine&#8221; I smiled at her and walked to my room. I thought about the whole day&#8217;s episodes. A lot had happened. And the worst being my break up with Arun. He was trying to meet me from a week, I was busy with my other commitments so had to keep postponing our meet. I could see by his texts that he was quite annoyed waiting. But I had set my own priorities and I had things that were more important than meeting him. No, it does not mean that he is not important; he is indeed important part of my life. I love him and I do care for him. But that does not mean I keep him before everything else in my life. But he expected me to do that. He always complained how other girls treated their boyfriends as their first and only priority. He used to ask, why I had to work so much and also study diploma courses. I always told him, I&#8217;m an ambitions girl with a lot of plans and I don&#8217;t regret being that way. As this is what gave me happiness. He never got satisfied with that answer. Nor did I try to convince him. Because I always thought that, Arun was someone who understood me and will stay with me no matter what.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    But that was the case initially. He never asked me why I did not reply to his messages or why I could not meet him. He always told me, its okay sweetheart I totally understand that you&#8217;re busy. But after few months, he started getting irritated for my late replies, for my sudden cancel of our meeting plans. And whenever we met, he tried his best to convince me to quit what I&#8217;m doing now and pick up some easy jobs instead. This would ultimately lead to another disagreement and thus another few days of no text and no calls.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    This went on for few weeks when finally he decided to meet me up without informing, which I don&#8217;t otherwise prefer. But I could not just get away without talking to him, so asked him to wait for few minutes that he agreed too. I finished all my works at my office and asked my supervisor to give me an hour permission for which he looked at me in surprise and asked &#8221; Akshara !! Is everything alright? &#8221; I just nodded my head with an assuring smile and left. This is the reason why I don&#8217;t like unplanned meetings. Not every unplanned events turned out to be fun, if not for everyone; at least in my case. I went to the parking lot where he was standing. I asked should I take my vehicle or will he drop me back here, he said to get mine and he would prefer to drive all alone in his car, which was not the case always. By that, it was quite clear that he was upset with something. When riding, I replayed all the conversation we had in last few days. I did not actually find any major fights or disagreement that had happened recently. The fact was that we had hardly been talking to each other from few weeks due to my busy schedules.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    As I was having all these things running in my head, I reached the place where we usually met. I parked my vehicle and looked for his car, it was still not there, and maybe he was stuck in the signal. I looked at the coffee shop, The Matteo, this was the place where I had first met Arun. He had come with his colleagues. I had gone alone like I usually do. He saw me with the book of his favorite author Michael Connelly &nbsp;and came to ask me where I had got it from. Actually that was just a reason needed for him to start a conversation; I could easily make it out. He was actually happy to see a girl with a Michael Connelly’s book. But as we spoke, we were very surprised to see how our interests matched. We loved books from same author, preferred to read books instead of watching movies, loved tasting different coffee brands, basically we felt like meeting a lost twin.

    By the time, we had almost spoke about everything I realized I was late to get back home. I told him that we could continue on some other day. He got up to drop me till my vehicle and as I was about to leave, he asked me for my contact number. I started with 97 and then suddenly a very weird idea stuck me. I told him &#8220;Arun, let&#8217;s give chance to the fate to make us meet again, so that I can give my number to you&#8230;!&#8221; He had a confused look. I said if you have to get my number you should probably wait for another coffee meet. He just smiled and said “Not less than a week, we will meet each other&#8221;. I liked his confidence. I waved a bye and rode past him.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    It was exact week, I had met him. I had not gone to that particular coffee shop thinking he would have visited it. I so badly wanted to go, but something stopped me. After work on that day, I planned to go to The Blossoms to see if I could get some books. I went and got two books that I found interesting. I went to the billing counter and as I was about to pay the amount, someone from my back read the title of my book purchased and said &#8220;Ma&#8217;am you have good choice&#8221; I felt I knew this voice, I turned back to see Arun. As I looked at him, he gave a big smile with a wink and said &#8220;Please pay the amount as the queue is pretty long&#8221;. I quietly paid the amount and went out to wait for him. He came with a book in his hand.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I saw him and asked &#8220;Hey! Are you following me?&#8221; He smiled and said “I was here even before you came, I saw you coming and I was already searching for a book, so No I did not follow you. I saw him with a puzzled look. He saw me and said &#8220;Akshara, it&#8217;s fate I guess; would you like to join me for a coffee?&#8221; I nodded my head. As I went to my scooty, he called my name and asked if I could accompany in his car as he usually won&#8217;t enjoy driving all alone. He said he would drop me back to the bookstore, so that I could go back home.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    That was the day, I fell for Arun. I trusted that fate brings two people together if it has to. We exchanged our numbers. We both knew that we had already started liking each other. Those initial days were the best.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I suddenly heard my name being called out loud. I looked around to see him. I was lost in the thoughts that I did not even notice his car coming. We both went into the coffee shop. We ordered our same old orders. Both sat in silence wanting the other one to start. Finally he broke the silence and asked &#8220;Akshara what is happening with you?&#8221; I looked at him with a blank face. He asked again saying I&#8217;m talking to you, please answer me. I was still confused about what he was asking. I told him &#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    He then spoke about how we don&#8217;t talk like before. How I don&#8217;t make time for him anymore. He came up with a list of things I don&#8217;t do. I thought to myself, how much he must have prepared for this. He spoke continuously for few minutes. I heard him with patience. After he completed, I explained him how I was caught in between so many things and I could not make time for him. I told him to understand my situation rather than blaming me. He got even more disturbed hearing me saying I was busy. The argument went from our lives to the way we have been bought up.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I was taken aback when he said &#8220;Akshara, let me tell you, it&#8217;s in your genes I think, just like your mother, you don&#8217;t know to handle relationship. Years ago she did the same thing and lost your dad and now it&#8217;s you doing the same.&#8221; I could feel myself becoming weaker suddenly; I had tears in my eyes, no words coming out. I was not ready to hear this from Arun, the guy whom I believed will be my strength, suddenly made me feel so vulnerable. I looked at him, he seemed to be alright. In fact his face was relaxed after saying so much. He said, if I&#8217;m not the first in your priorities, let me not be in your life at all. Goodbye. He just walked away saying these words. I sat there thinking what to do.
  </div>

    I was pulled to my present by a knock on my door. I wiped my tears and went to open my door. My mom stood there holding a tray with pasta and some French fries along with a lemonade. I saw her with a forceful smile and asked her why so much. She smiled back at me and said &#8220;Eating good food will help you forget those disturbing moments of our lives&#8221;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    She was the strongest and most &nbsp;independent women I had ever seen. She divorced my dad when I was 10. She fought in court to take me into custody. And the court declared that I will be taken care by my mom. She never opposed me from meeting my dad on weekends. She never told anything bad about him. She used to just say that things did not go good between us. No one was wrong or right, it was just we were very different was her usual explanation when asked about the divorce. I learnt a lot from her. From being independent and strong to being caring and soft. She was a complete package. She was there when I got less marks in math in my 12th Std, she was with me to celebrate my first rank in my graduation. She was with me in my every step. She did not stop me from experimenting with my career choices. She just told me it&#8217;s my life and it will be as I design it.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I saw her with a pride in my eyes and thought to myself; No, she is not someone who does not know to handle a relationship. But she is the one who knows how not to spoil it. She could have stayed with my dad by having fights every now and then; instead she made a choice not to make me see those fights and took a divorce. She never complained about my dad, which shows her maturity in knowing people. She was matured in her own way. She does not need a man to support her or make her complete. She completed herself. I might be like her, independent, but that does not mean I don&#8217;t know to handle the relationship. It will take someone as matured as me to see it my way, I thought.

    As these thoughts ran through my head, my mom started talking about hilarious incidents that had happened at her workplace. I listened to her and burst out laughing. Watching me laugh, made her face glow. She felt her efforts gave her the results that she wanted. Though I had a hard day with the break up, I was happy that the respect and love for my mom went two folds more. What if I lost one relation, I found one with my mom which was more rewarding and unconditional making me realize that, in her happiness lies mine.&nbsp;
