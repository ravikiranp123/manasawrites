    Six years back on the same day, I had met Clara in a shopping complex. I still remember how she was so much worried about her lost card. She had just swiped the card in a store and walked out. When she tried to put her card into her purse, it had slipped to the ground. Since she was in a hurry to rush out, she had not noticed it. I was right behind her in the billing counter and somehow happened to see her drop her card. I ran to take the card and tried shouting Ma’am, but I guess she did not hear me. I ran back to the counter paid the amount for things that I had bought and went in the same direction I had seen her leaving. After searching for few minutes, I found her. Though I had not seen her face so clearly I could find with the help of her dress. I went where she stood in the middle of the moving crowd lost in her own world trying to recollect something and at the same time searching hurriedly in her bag as well as in her purse. I went and stood in front of her, watching her made me forget what I was there for. She had the prettiest faces that I had ever come across. There was something that had attracted me in her. I had totally fallen for her that very moment.

    She looked up to me and gave a confused look. She looked even more cute. I just stood there like an idiot and smiled. She said “que ?”. I did not know what she was speaking. I just gave a blank look and handed over the card to her. The expression on her face changed so quickly. She saw the card and started talking in some language that I had never heard before. But something that took me by surprise is, she saw me with a big smile and said something which again I failed to understand and then the next very second straightly gave a hug. I had no clue how to respond.

    I had heard my friends saying about how western culture is so very different from ours. But this experience was totally unexpected. I just stood there like a statue. She smiled at me, uttered some words and walked towards the exit doors. I am not actually a very big movie fan; I watch movies for time pass. But on that day I suddenly remembered how they depicted a girl who is walking away from the guy, if turns to see him back would mean she loves him. I know that it was stupid thing to think about all that at that moment. But my heart requested me to stand there and give it a chance. And the same thing happened; she looked back and not just looked but also smiled. My happiness had no boundaries. Suddenly I remembered that I did not ask her name or anything else. I went back running to see if I could find her, but all I could see was she getting into her car, a bright yellow one and leaving towards the main road. Thank god I used my brain and tried to memorize the car number.

    That day I remember sharing this with my roommates. One made fun of me, but the other asked what I wanted to do next. I told him I will search for her. He said that would be a tedious job, but said he will help me. I had never liked any girl back in India this way, not definitely the way I tried to search Clara. Finally after a lot of circus, I did find her. I got to know where she stays and her name. But I thought visiting her directly would not be such a good idea. So tried to follow her and see where she visited every day. &nbsp;She had two places that she went frequently. After few research and enquiries I got to know she teaches violin in a music academy and goes to learn English in a Tutorial.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My next plan was to join to the English learning classes. There are days when I found it surprising to myself thinking what and all had I done to meet her. Being very fluent in English, I somehow managed to get into the same class she attends. On my first day I was as nervous as I was when I entered the college on my first day. No, not due to the class but it was due to her presence. The best part was she did recognize and said “Thank you hmmm… the card you gave that day…. in mall”. Though her sentence was grammatically a disaster, I loved the way she tried to talk English with me. The one thing that worried me was how to learn to talk English the way she did, so no gets doubt on me. For few days I was answering in one word which made half the class believe that I was new to English and later learned to talk broken English like the rest of the class.

    As days went by, I got closer to Clara, I got to know that she is from Spain who recently moved to New York as she had completed her courses in Violin and wanted to teach. Finally got to know what she spoke to me in mall was Spanish. She was staying with her uncle in Spain as her parents had passed away in a car accident when she was 5 years old. From then she had been taken care by her uncle. Now she wanted to lead an independent life. Her life inspired me so much. I, being the youngest kid in the family have not only been pampered by my parents, but the whole relatives who knew me pampered me with love and care. Even after all that, I still had complaints about life, but Clara was so very different. Though she hardly got the care and love she wanted, she never complained about anything, instead had a positive outlook towards everything. She was a gem of a person. The more time I spent with her, the more I started liking her.

  <div>
    She not only told about herself, but also asked about me, my family and the cultures in India. She seemed to be interested in everything related to India. She always mentioned how she would love to visit India once in her life. I wanted to tell her, come with me, I will take you there and we can live forever, but I was so scared to open up. I had never feared rejections this way. The very thought of me getting to hear No from her made me feel so disturbed. My project in my company was almost coming to an end. I had to leave New York by a month. We were winding up all the remaining works. I had to tell Clara what I felt. This was the time, as this would never come again in my life. I called her up and said I wanted to meet her urgently. She asked if everything was alright. I told her everything was fine I just had to tell her something important. She said she will meet me by 5 in the evening. That is 3 hours from the time I called. I had rehearsed what to talk to her for more than 100times. As I was doing this I thought, if at all I had done this rehearsal for any of those interviews I had attended, I would have been working in one the top most companies. The importance I had started giving to Clara was difficult to put it in words.

    At 4 30 I was in the café where we had decided to meet. She reached by sharp 5. My hands started shivering. I grasped them and held it tight. I was sweating in that cold Ac room. She came sat in front of me with a big smile on her face, the smile that gave me courage to tell her what I felt. I started from the incident that happened in mall, to tracing her car number to joining English classes only to meet her. She heard me patiently. After I told her everything I told her that I would like to spend my whole life with her and that I felt complete being with her. She did not speak for a minute. That was the longest silence between us till that day. Then she said “Krish, I know what you’re trying to say, but I am not ready for any sort of relationship and I am not ready to leave my job and this country and go anywhere else. I am sorry.”

    This was the worst fear I always had and yes I had heard her speak the same thing that I never wanted to hear from her. But she had made up her mind. I tried to convince her, but no. She held her decision. And after sometime, said a goodbye and left quietly. After that day, spending next 15 days in New York was the most hardest for me. But only good thing was I would be leaving the city and also those memories back in there and come to India.

    It was almost 5 months in Bangalore. I was trying to forget Clara, but her thoughts, her smile and her talks never left me. My home, my family and my friends everyone were the same, but I could not be as happy I was before I left India. One day when I was on my way to parking lot to get my car, I heard a familiar voice calling my name. I ignored it the first time thinking it is all in my mind. But I heard it little more louder again, I turned back to see. I could not believe my eyes. It was Clara, she looked as beautiful and pretty like the day I saw her. She came to me and stood with a smiled. We stood there in silence for few minutes. She said “Won’t you ask why I am here?” I nodded my head with a No and smiled. The very next moment she hugged me tight and whispered in my ears” I came for you”.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    She had quit her job and vacated her rented house in New York, packed her clothes and had come for me. I could not believe it, she said how she felt after I left the city and she contacted my other friends who were still there and got to know where I work and came in search of me. At that very moment I felt I am the happiest man in this whole planet.

    The next challenge was to make my parents and my family accept her. The family that considered a neighboring town girl as an outsider had to accept a girl from different country as their daughter In law. They tried their best to stop me from this decision. But I had already decided about my life partner. So they finally gave up and changed their mind. It is 5 years we are married now and my mom says her best friend is Clara. They have turned out to be more of daughter and mother then the in law. She had managed to learn Kannada in a year. And she also learnt a lot about our culture. She loved every little thing about my family and my mom loved that about her. Clara not only succeeded in being the best daughter in law, but she is great mom for our 2 year old son too.

    When I look at her now, all I think is I made a right decision by choosing to love her. Though our cultures, our languages, our interests never matched, one thing that held us together is the Love. As for Love the Boundaries are seem Boundless.
