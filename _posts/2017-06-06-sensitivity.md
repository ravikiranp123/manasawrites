    Once upon a time, in a village lived an old man. He stayed alone in his house. He had a habit of going to take bath by going to a nearby river every day. One day as he went to the river and when he was about to enter the river, on the bank, he noticed a beautiful colorful pebble.

    &nbsp;It was so beautiful that he could not take his eyes from them. He slowly went to it and took it in his hand. He was so happy to watch it that he totally forgot what he had come for. All he could think about at that moment was that he wanted to show it to his daughter who lived with her husband in the neighboring village. He took the pebble safely in his hand to his home.

    He could not take away his eyes from the pebble. He kept it in his hand all the way and also after he reached home, he still had it in his hands. During the night he kept it next to his pillow. He got up early in the morning and saw the pebble again. Then suddenly something stuck him, he had tears in his eyes for what he had done.

    He saw the beautiful pebble with his teary eyes and he quickly rushed to the same river that he had got it from. He slowly placed the pebble in its place. After placing it there, he had a big smile on his face. He was kind of relieved. He saw the pebble with eyes filled with love and affection and told “I will get my daughter here to watch the beauty of you, sorry that I forcefully pulled you from your origin. You must have been hurt. Now I have decided to enjoy your beauty by keeping it in your own place, with your friends and family. I hope you would stay till I get my daughter here, so she will also be able to enjoy your beauty the same way as me”.

    The old man has given all of us a very valuable message behind his action. Only if people started become sensitive to everything we see around us, life would be so much easier. We have started thinking being sensitive as a weakness. But to the true fact, it is not a weakness, but strength as a human being. As we turn out to be sensitive to the outer world, we not only become more understanding and sympathetic to others, but we also become more sensitive to our own self and our own emotions.
