    I somehow can’t stop myself being so anxious. I wanted to stay positive. I wanted to hope for the best. But all thoughts in me were completely negative. I tried pushing them away. As harder I tried, I found it more difficult to control these thoughts. I sat lost in these thoughts.&nbsp; There was a tap on my shoulder, I was startled. Arjun held my shoulder and said, “Hey it’s me”. I remember him going for bath a few minutes before. And already he was ready to accompany me. He did not look as tensed as me. I looked into his eyes, they spoke a lot, and assured me things will be fine. &nbsp;There were no words exchanged. Maybe he understood I was anxious and did not want to make it more evident by talking to me about it. As we drove, he held my hand and pressed it gently. I looked at him, he said, “We had decided to take anything that comes on our way together, Right?” I nodded and was about to speak, he interrupted and said,” Honey, trust me, anything that happens, happens for the best”. He winked looking at me. This was the same line that I had used when he was undergoing major losses in his business. He used to be so anxious and have sleepless nights. And every time, I saw him being worried, I used to tell him the same thing. Arjun and me had been into numerous difficulties from the times, we had started dating. We initially had fights with each other, but never let the relationship sink. We later had difficulties in convincing our parents for our wedding. Since I belonged to orthodox Catholics and he was from typical Brahmin family. But we both were very determined to stay with each other. And I was the always the person who had maintained my calmness. In all those times, I was being support to Arjun. But now, I cannot believe myself, how fragile I have turned out to be. &nbsp;The car stopped and I realized we had reached our destination.&nbsp; I somehow did not want to go into the hospital. I was scared, scared of hearing what I did not wanted to hear. I tried to walk slow, so I go to the doctor’s cabin slow. I only had lord’s name all along the way. I finally reached. We were sitting in front of the doctor. She understood, I was a little uncomfortable. So, to make me feel more at ease, she started talking all general things. We spoke about all things away from what we had been gone there for. But it did made me feel a bit lighter. And, then she started explaining what the test that I had under gone was all about in detail. Later, she came to the results part. And yes, she told the same thing which I was not ready to hear. The same thing that I feared would happen from morning. I was already into tears. Arjun held me tight. But I was uncontrollably crying. I was somehow not ready to take this. I prayed that this should be a bad dream and wake up to the reality. But nothing was changing. Arjun tried his best to console me. I was not ready to accept the fact that I could not be a mother. I could not conceive. The love for kids in me was immense. From the time I got married, I dreamt of having a kid and being a mother. But how could god be so cruel to me. How could he take away only wish that I had. I had so many thoughts, I was completely devastated.

    We came back home. All the way, Arjun was trying to convince me for going to another hospital or looking for some other doctors. But I did not answer him. I was lost in my own thoughts. We have been married to close to eight years and we had tried visiting all doctors in the city possible. This was supposed to be one of the finest one and where most of them got positive results. But my fate seems to be so bad, that out of only those few unlucky ones, I am one. Arjun cooked lunch for us. I was not ready to talk to anyone. My mom had been calling from morning and did not feel like telling her anything. Finally she had decided to call Arjun and he explained things in better way. She still wanted to talk to me, but he said I wasn’t still ready to talk to people. I guess she understood my situation or maybe just tired to let me be myself.

    Next two days, went in complete silence. Arjun tried to help me all my kitchen works, he had also called my office asked for a break for a week. He was trying to be as sweet and calm as possible. I had never seen him be so patient from the day I have known him. He is the most impulsive guy anyone would ever meet in their lives.&nbsp; But he has been so much caring and understanding from last two days. I indeed must feel blessed to have him in my life.

    After dinner, as I sat gazing at the dark sky in the balcony, Arjun walked towards me. I looked at him and smiled. He sat in front of me. I understood he had come to talk to me. I looked at him. He started talking about something I did not want to hear. I requested him I m not in the mood to hear what he is going to say. But he asked me to stay patients till he completes. He wanted to adopt a kid. But I wasn’t ready for his decision. I was somehow never okay to adopt a kid for me. But Arjun was persistently putting forward this idea. I got up from my chair and walked without saying anything to him. I guess he got his answer. We spent few more weeks hardly talking to each other. I got to know he was unhappy with me. But I was not ready to talk to him either, as I knew he would try convincing me again for adoption.

    After close to a month as I enter home I could hear an unfamiliar voice. Arjun was talking to someone. I went near the kitchen to find a little girl of age maybe 5 or 6 sitting and watching Arjun cook food. She was as cute as a doll. I stood there watching as Arjun was singing rhymes with her. Then Arjun looked at me, and he came to hug me and then took me to her. I asked him, Who is this kid ? &nbsp;I don’t know what made me think of that, but I just blurted out. He looked at me shocked and said, “This is our daughter, Alisha”. I was totally taken aback. Even after so many discussions and after very well knowing that I am not in for this decision, he had gone forward and adopted a kid. I was very disappointed. I did not what to do. I wanted to shout at him, but I saw the girl was staring at us. I just looked at him in anger and told him I will wait for him upstairs and went away.

    After an hour, Arjun came with the dinner in his hand. I was in no mood to eat. I told him I did not like what he had done. He tried to give all reasons. He told me about the girls background. She was from an orphanage. Her dad had left her mom when she was a baby, and mother had no means to take care of the kid, so gave her to an orphanage. But then they got to know that the her mother met with an accident and died in hospital. After hearing about Alisha’s past, I did feel bit sad for her. But I wasn’t ready to take her as our daughter. I fought with him till I am tired and finally went to bed weeping.

    I got up in the morning to the noises from downstairs. I went to see what it was, Arjun was helping Alisha get ready for school and she was playing games as he was trying to hold her and get her dressed.&nbsp; I went down while they both looked at me, I did not talk to either of them. Alisha tried looking at me and smiling. It was very hard for me not to smile back as I was always fond of kids, but when I looked at her, it somehow reminded me how I could not have my own kid. That feeling would make me hate myself and also Arjun for going against my wish

    As days moved by, this became a routine. And now Alisha tried even more to talk to me. But I was only answering her in a word. But she never felt discouraged or offended. The very next moment she would run back to me with something to share with me. Diwali was one festival I always enjoyed celebrating, and&nbsp; I was awaiting to light lamps and decorate whole house. On the day of Diwali, Arjun came to me and handed me a box, I saw it and smiled widely. He nodded saying, “This is for Aliisha, I want you to give to her”. I returned back the box, but he was stern. Finally I had to agree, I asked what the box had, he asked me to stay with her and open it. I was not even interested to know now, but since I had no choice, I went to her. I gave her the box, she was first surprised, then she double checked if it was really for her. After assuring, she started opening it. I had never seen her so close any time before, I observed every reaction of hers. Her every move showed how excited she was, and as I saw her, without even knowing I had a smile on my face. Looking at me smile she got even happier in opening it. Finally she saw it was a pretty Barbie doll. She was overwhelmed, she hugged me tight and kissed me on my cheek. I stood there lost in her happiness, I pulled her close and asked, “Are you so happy because it had Barbie doll”? She looked at me with a big smile and said in joy, “This is my first ever gift till now”. I was speechless now, she was already 7 years and she had not received a single gift. And first one happened to be by me. I had mixed emotions. I was so engrossed in all this, that I did not even know I had tears in my eyes. She looked at my tears and suddenly stopped rejoicing, she came closer to me and asked, “Are you feeling sad cause no one gifted you Barbie? Don’t worry I will ask daddy to get one for you, Okay?” I was speechless, I hugged her tight and told her, “Who said I don’t have a Barbie? I have one of the most prettiest one. Will u see her? She nodded. I took her to the mirror and showed her the Barbie that I held. She saw herself and looked at me with a smile and all I could do was hug her. I realized what I had missed since so many days and was glad Arjun made me give that gift. And also understood some relations has nothing to do with blood, it’s purely made by heart. Alisha made my life brighter with her innocence on that festival of lights.
